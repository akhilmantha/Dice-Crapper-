# Dice-Crapper-
This game is built without any gameframeworks.
Playing Dicecrapper is easy, it's just like dice craps, hence the name. The game has two rounds. 
The first round is the initial roll and is called the Come Out round. 
Score a 2, 3, or 12 and it is craps - you lose! Scoring a 7 or 11 is considered a Natural and you win with the first roll!
However, if you score 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 then it is considered Point. 
This moves you to the next round of gameplay. Whatever your initial roll was you must repeat that roll (any dice combo works as long as the total is the same). 
If you hit a 7 you lose the point round and it's game over. In a real crap game bets would be placed on each round, the come out and the point round, and dealers would render bets after each roll depending if you are continuing or crapping out with a 7. 
Bets can be placed against the point and for the point. Bets in this version are always for the point.
